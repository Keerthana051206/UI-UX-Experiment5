UX Project Scenarios
Scenario 1: Designing a Public Transport App for Daily Commuters
1. UX Problem Statements
User Pain Points:
- Unpredictable bus/train arrival times.
- Lack of real-time updates or delay notifications.
- Complex interface while navigating routes or schedules.
Problem Statements:
1. "A daily commuter needs a way to view real-time bus/train locations because fixed schedules often dont
reflect delays, which results in missed rides and extended wait times."
2. "A first-time traveler needs a way to navigate unfamiliar routes easily because the app lacks clear, guided
steps, which results in stress and confusion during the journey."
2. Research Methods & Justification
- Field Observations: To watch how people interact with existing apps in transit environments.
- Interviews: To collect specific needs and pain points.
- Usability Testing (on-the-go): To evaluate how users interact while commuting.
Justification:
- Observations uncover real-time context and distractions.
- Interviews provide habit insights.
- Usability testing ensures practical usability.
